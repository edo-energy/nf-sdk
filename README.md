NF SDK
=====

Welcome to the NF SDK.  This repository contains a `docker-compose`
file which you can use to run a local copy of NF; and generated client
libraries for Javascript and Python for the gRPC APIs.  You can also
use the REST API directly.

To use, first `docker login` using the API key you received.  After
this, you should be able to run `docker-compose up` and then visit
http://localhost:8080/ to visit the NF console.
